# Monte Carlo Simulation for Pricing Asian Options

This project covers the following:
- Conducted a computational verification of the Milstein scheme's superior approximation of the closed-form solution compared to the Euler-Maruyama scheme, achieving a significant reduction in the sum of squares error.
- Priced various types of Asian options (including options with fixed or floating strike; discrete or continuous sampling; arithmetic or geometric averaging) using Monte Carlo simulation.
- Analyzed the sensitivity of Asian option value to the underlying stock price, volatility, interest rate, and time-to-maturity.
